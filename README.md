# Crablet

So far, just an experiment

## Inspirations

* [The Aggregate is dead. Long live the Aggregate! - Sara Pellegrini & Milan SaviÄ‡. - The main motivation for Crablet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpalYQaKKd4)
* [Event Sourcing You are doing it wrong by David Schmitz. - Very good advices. I will try events as plain JSON.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GzrZworHpIk)
* [Json-values: I guess it's a perfect library for using events as plain JSON. Crablet is agnostic about it, but I will try it in Crablet examples.](https://github.com/imrafaelmerino/json-values) by [Rafael Merino](https://github.com/imrafaelmerino)
* [My previous event sourcing experiment: Crabzilla. I learned a lot but it ended as a framework. Crablet hopefully will be just a library.](https://github.com/crabzilla/crabzilla)
